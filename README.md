# Horst
Horst is a interpreted programming language for a school project with the goal to be easy to understand and a good first programming language for other students.

## Installation

1. Dowload the .zip file from the [releases](https://github.com/NinoDS/Horst/releases/).
2. Extract the file to your Horst directory e.g. 'C:\Horst'.
3. Add the Horst path to the PATH environment variable. *1
```cmd
  setx /M PATH "%PATH%;C:\Horst\"
```
4. Done :) You can now use horst! Check out the horst docs for more info.


*1: WARNING: This solution may be destructive to your PATH, and the stability of your system. As a side effect, it will merge your user and system PATH, and truncate PATH to 1024 characters. The effect of this command is irreversible. Make a backup of PATH first.
